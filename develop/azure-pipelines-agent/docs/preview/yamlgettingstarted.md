# Moved!

We've moved the YAML documentation out of preview and over to the official [docs site](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started-yaml).

<small>If you're really stuck and need to get the old preview docs, the last commit where they were updated is <code><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/blob/3d39fca3cac2bf54c16600e0a3b9e7972d4c5ef3/docs/preview/yamlgettingstarted.md">3d39fca</a></code>.</small>
