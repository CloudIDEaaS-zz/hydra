/* DESCRIPTION       :                                           *
* This class provides the generic and extendible Collection      *
* class and its item base object. Collection is an extendible    *
* container type of class. It defines the overridable methods    *
* for managing contained objects. Benefit of this is that        *
* applications could easily switch Collection types whenever they*
* want to. For example, initially, an array Collection was used  *
* and later it was found that array searching is so slow and a   *
* need to use a Collection offering faster searches then, a      *
* Btree(look for Gerry's Btree Collection implementation)        *
* Collection might be introduced and could be easily swapped to  *
* the old array Collection. Only the code that instantiates the  *
* Collection object needs to be changed.                         */

// 06/02/2001   Gerardo
// - .NET migration work.

// 04/30/1999	Gerardo
// - Write operation request will no longer wait until all overlapping Read 
//	requests had been served. After serving the last Read operation and the
//	requested operation is Write, will prioritize the Write in that succeeding
//	Read requests while Write is waiting for its turn will wait until the Write
//	operation had been served.

// 04/24/1999	Gerardo
// - Decided to support Key & Data through inheritance. Descendant Collection
//	classes will be introduced to support it.

// 03/23/1999	Gerardo
// - Changed back return types from bool to 'short'. 'short' will
//	allow us to support multiple error return types.
// 06/18/1998	Gerardo
// - Added multi-thread support.
